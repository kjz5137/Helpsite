        <title>How To: Make a Chainmaille Bracelet</title>
    </head>

        <h1><u>How To Make a Chainmaille Bracelet</u></h2>
        <p class = "bordered">The knights of medieval times wore entire suits of interwoven rings.  Here, we will learn how to replicate that pattern to make a basic chainmaille bracelet.</p>
        <div class = "step">
            <h3>Step 1: Selecting your ring material</h3>
            <p>Go to <a href = "https://theringlord.com/cart/shopdisplaycategories.asp?id=1&cat=Rings">theringlord.com</a> and select your rings.  You can find their selection of rings on the left side of their home page.  Figure 1 ranks the difficulty of the materials available; <b><u>it is recommended to start with an easier material</u></b>, such as aluminum or copper.</p>

            </figure>
            <p class = "greentext"><i>Toughness</i> or <i>Difficulty</i> is the force needed to bend a ring.</p>
            <p class = "greentext"><i>Springback</i> is the tendency for a ring to "spring" back into its original shape.  This is different from toughness as a ring can be springy and soft (much like the spring in a pen) or tough and not springy.</p>
            <p class = "bluetext">Avoid getting rubber rings, engineered plastic, or punched rings.  It is unadvised to get carbon steel, plated, or enameled copper, but they can still work.</p>
        </div>
        <div class = "step">
            <h3>Step 2: Picking your rings</h3>
            <p>Purchase rings for your project.  They must be 16ga 1/4" rings in whatever material you have chosen.</p>
            <figure>
                <img src = "RingSelection.png" alt = "Ring purchase page">
                <figcaption>Figure 2</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p class = "greentext"><i>AR</i>, or <i>Aspect Ratio</i>, is the proportion of a ring's inside diameter to its outside diameter.  All weaves have a lower limit to their compatible aspect ratio, and some have an upper limit as well.</p>
            <p class = "bluetext">More information about ring ARs can be found at <a href = "https://www.mailleartisans.org/weaves/weavedisplay.php?key=6">the M.A.I.L. page</a>.</p>
        </div>
        <div class = "step">
            <h3>Step 3: Picking your clasp</h3>
            <p>Purchase a clasp for your project.  They are found on <a href = "https://theringlord.com/cart/shopdisplaycategories.asp?id=1&cat=Rings">theringlord.com</a> on the left under "jewelry supplies".  We are using a 15mm stainless steel clasp.</p>

                <figcaption>Figure 3</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p class = "bluetext">Ensure that your clasp can fit onto 16ga wire in the clasp description.</p>
        </div>
        <div class = "step">
            <h3>Step 4: Selecting your tools</h3>
            <p>Grab a pair of pliers to work with.  It doesn't really matter which ones you use, but make sure you have two of them.  Smaller pliers are easier to work with, but have a tougher time bending difficult rings.</p>
            <p class = "bluetext"><b>Be careful!</b>  Pliers without teeth will leave less scratches on your project, but increase the chance of slipping and causing injury.</p>
        </div>
        <div class = "step">
            <h3>Step 5: Prepare your rings</h3>
            <p>Make two separate piles, one of opened rings and one of closed rings.  You want about twice as many closed rings as you have open rings.</p>
